Git works on a DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) to maintain commit history

*Git Objects*
A commit object is a simple text file that contains information such as the commit user information, commit message, a reference to the commits parent or parents and a reference to the root tree of the project. That information is all that Git needs to rebuild the full contents of a commit. 
An annotated tag is a reference to a specific commit. 
A tree is an object that contains a list of the file names and directories inside of a directory. 
A blob is an object that stores the content of a file that is being managed by Git. 

GIT ID is a hash (sha-1) value of an object. It is unique for a given file/object. GIt object names are also known as git ids

*References*
Reference is a user friendly name that points to a commits sha-1 value
